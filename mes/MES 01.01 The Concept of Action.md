### 1. The Concept of Action

### 1. 行动的概念

THE DISTINCTIVE AND CRUCIAL FEATURE in the study of man is the concept of *action*.<sup>[1]</sup>*Human action is defined simply as purposeful behavior.* It is therefore sharply distinguishable from those observed movements which, from the point of view of man, are not purposeful. These include all the observed movements of inorganic matter and those types of human behavior that are purely reflex, that are simply involuntary responses to certain stimuli. *Human action*, on the other hand, can be *meaningfully interpreted* by other men, for it is governed by a certain *purpose* that the actor has in view.<sup>[2]</sup>The purpose of a man’s act is his *end*; the desire to achieve this end is the man’s *motive* for instituting the action.

对人的研究中**最为独特且至关重要的特征**，乃是**行动**这一概念。<sup>[1]</sup>*人的行动（human action）可以简明地定义为有意图的行为*。因此，人的行动鲜明地区别于那些从人的视角看来并非出于意图的可观测运动。后者包括所有可观测的无机物质运动，以及那些纯粹是反射性的人类行为——也就是对特定刺激的无意识反应。与之不同，**人的行动**能够被他人**有意义地解读**，因为它受行动者内心向往的某种意图所支配。<sup>[2]</sup>一个人的行动的意图即为他的**目的**（end）。而达成这一目的的欲求，则是其发起行动的**动机**（motive）。

All human beings *act* by virtue of their existence and their nature as human beings.<sup>[3]</sup> We could not conceive of human beings who do not act purposefully, who have no ends in view that they desire and attempt to attain. Things that did not *act*, that did not behave purposefully, would no longer be classified as human.

基于人之存在及其本性，所有人都会**行动**。<sup>[1]</sup>我们无法想象这样的人类，他们不会有意图地行动，他们没有任何渴望并力图实现的目的。那些不会**行动**、不以意图导向的事物，将不再被归入人类的范畴。

It is this fundamental truth—this axiom of human action—that forms the key to our study. The entire realm of praxeology and its best developed subdivision, economics, is based on an analysis of the necessary logical implications of this concept.<sup>[4]</sup> The fact that men act by virtue of their being human is indisputable and incontrovertible. To assume the contrary would be an absurdity. The contrary—the absence of motivated behavior—would apply only to plants and inorganic matter.<sup>[5]</sup>]

正是这一基本真理——人的行动公理——构成了我们研究的关键。整个行动学（praxeology ）领域及其最发达的分支——经济学，都建立在对这一概念所蕴含的必然逻辑推论的分析之上。<sup>[4]</sup>人因其本性而行动，这一事实无可辨驳且不容置疑。假定事实的反面将是荒谬的。事实的反面——无动机行为——仅适用于植物和无机物质。<sup>[5]</sup>

[4] This chapter consists solely of a development of the logical implications of the existence of human action. Future chapters—the further parts of the structure—are developed with the help of a very small number of subsidiary assumptions. Cf. Appendix below and Murray N. Rothbard, “Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller,” *American Economic Review*, December, 1951, pp. 943–46; and “In Defense of ‘Extreme Apriorism,’” *Southern Economic Journal*, January, 1957, pp. 314–20.

[4] 本章仅对人的行动的存在这一事实的逻辑蕴涵进行了展开。后续章节——即该理论结构的进一步展开——则是在极少数辅助性假设的帮助下建立起来的。参见下文附录以及 Murray N. Rothbard, “Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller,” *American Economic Review*, December, 1951, pp. 943–46; 以及 “In Defense of ‘Extreme Apriorism,’” *Southern Economic Journal*, January, 1957, pp. 314–20.

[5] There is no need to enter here into the difficult problem of animal behavior, from the lower organisms to the higher primates, which might be considered as on a borderline between purely reflexive and motivated behavior. At any rate, men can *understand* (as distinguished from merely observe) such behavior only in so far as they can impute to the animals motives that they can understand.

[5] 这里无需深入探讨一个复杂的动物行为难题：从低等生物到高等灵长类动物，它们的行为可能被认为介于纯粹的反射行为和有动机的行为之间。无论如何，人类只有通过将自身能够理解的动机投射到动物身上，方能**理解**（而非单纯观测）此类行为。
